# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hi! I'm Niels, a programmer based in Bonn, Germany. Welcome to my GitHub page where I showcase my projects and coding journey.

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Advanced Python techniques, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on Python projects, particularly those involving algorithmic challenges.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: v1per_zero on Discord
- âš¡ Current Competitions: I am an active participant in the BWINF (Bundeswettbewerb Informatik), though my solutions for the competition are not yet published here.
- ðŸ¤” Exploring: New challenges in the field of computer science and software development.

## My Projects

Here's a quick overview of some of the projects I've been working on:

### Advent of Code Solutions
- [Advent-of-Code](https://github.com/V1perZerofy/Advent-of-Code): Some of my solutions for various Advent of Code challenges.
- [2DPlatformer](https://github.com/V1perZerofy/2DPlatformer): The start of a small 2D Platformer. Helped me to learn some Lua.

(Note: My work for the BWINF competition is currently not available for public viewing due to competition guidelines. Additionally, I've developed a 'Substitutionplan' project, a digital system for displaying school substitution schedules. It's already being actively used in my school, and I plan to upload it to GitHub once it's completely anonymized to adhere to privacy standards.)
